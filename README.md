## Local Development 

In order to get around cors issues regarding local files, you must setup a local server for local development. Just 3 simple steps:

1.  [Download and Install node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt (on Windows you might need to open the command prompt as admin)
3.  In the terminal type:

        npm install -g http-server

Done!

From then on just `cd` to the folder that has the files you want to serve and type 

    http-server

Then point your browser at `http://localhost:8080/`
